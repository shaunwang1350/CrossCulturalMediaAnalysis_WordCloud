Artificial Intelligence program AlphaGo defeated the world's top-ranked Go-player Ke Jie in the first of three games on Tuesday in Wuzhen of east China's Zhejiang Province.After four-and-a-half hours of play, Ke, playing black, lost by 0.5 points, which is the narrowest margin possible in the game. The game follows Chinese Go rules with black having the advantage of first move, and a set point of 7.5 was later given to white to compensate for this.When asked about the match, Ke said he was shocked by a couple of moves during mid-game talks as those moves wouldn't be played by a human. "When I first saw it, I thought it was almost an impossible move for human players to come up with, since it is obviously a later step. But afterward, I realized it was really an astonishing move," said Ke. With a newly upgraded version of AlphaGo bolstered by reinforcement learning, the founder of DeepMind - the company behind AlphaGo, hopes Ke can help discover potential weaknesses of the program. "(Itâ€™s) Especially interesting for us to see in use some of the moves like the three-three move from the master series of games against AlphaGo, and we were very keen to see how AlphaGo will deal with its own strategies," said Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind. Ke Jie said AlphaGo has advanced much faster than he thought. "Compared to last year, AlphaGo's understanding of Go has progressed so much. Last year it played in a human-like way, but this time, it's almost like the God of Go," said Ke. There will be two more matches between Ke Jie and AlphaGo on Thursday and Saturday. AlphaGo gained worldwide fame when it scored a landmark 4-to-1 victory over South Korean Go master Le Se-dol in a five-round showdown last year, overturning the long held belief that machines can't beat professional Go players due to the game's complex, intuitive and creative nature. Ke, 19, became the youngest champion in Go history after winning three world titles within the space of one year between January 2015 and January 2016. The winner will be awarded 1.5 million U.S. dollars while the losing side takes home 300,000 dollars.http://www.cctvplus.com/news/20170523...Subscribe us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/CCTVPlusCCTV+ official website: http://www.cctvplus.com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cctv...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewsContent....Twitter: https://twitter.com/CCTV_Plus
